/// that only a small fraction of all the entries will be interacted with at an given time.
///
/// [`lazy`], and [`lazy_with_watchers`] are used to construct lazy directories.
///
/// A lazy directory contains two callbacks and a stream.  One callback, called `get_entry_names`,
/// which is used when a directory listing is requested.  Another callback, called `get_entry`, is
/// used to construct and actual entry when it is accessed.  A stream, called `watcher_events` is
/// used to send notifications to the currently connected watchers.
///
/// `get_entry_names` is provided with a position and a sink.  The position allows the caller to
/// retrieve entry names starting at a point other then the very first entry.  The sink is use to
/// consume entry names and it may not be able to consume the whole directory content at once as it
/// is backed by a limited size buffer.  "sink" will remember the last provided possition, allowing
/// the caller to resume the list operation.  See [`traversal_position::AlphabeticalTraversal`] for
/// an example of a type designed to be used as a traversal position.
///
/// `get_entry` is expected to return a reference to a [`DirectoryEntry`] instance backing an
/// individual entry.  Notice that currently there is no caching or sharing of entry objects.
/// Every new `Open()` request will cause new entry object to be allocated and used.  See #ZX-3631
/// for the caching policy discussion.
///
/// NOTE There might be an alternative design, where `get_entry_names` returns a stream of entry
/// names information.  The connection object will hold on to this stream, using it to populate
/// `ReadDirents` requests and destroying the stream when `Rewind` is called.
///
/// `watcher_events` is a stream of events that when occure are forwarded to all the connected
/// watchers.  They are values of type [`WatcherEvent`].  If this stream reaches it's end existing
/// watcher connections will be closed and any new watchers will not be able to connect to the node
/// - they will receive a NOT_SUPPORTED error.
