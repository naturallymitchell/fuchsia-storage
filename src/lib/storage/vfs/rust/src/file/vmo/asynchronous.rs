//! Implementation of a file backed by a VMO buffer shared by all the file connections.  From the
//! library user side, these files are backed by asynchronous `init_vmo` and/or `consume_vmo`
//! callbacks.
//!
//! Connections to this kind of file synchronize and perform operations on a shared VMO initially
//! provided by the `init_vmo` callback.   When the last connection is closed, `consume_vmo` is
//! called.  If `consume_vmo` is not provided, then the VMO is just dropped.
//!
//! `init_vmo` callback is called when the first connection to the file is established and is
//! responsible for providing a VMO to be used by all the connection.
//!
//! `consume_vmo` callback, if any, is called when the last active connection to the file is closed.
